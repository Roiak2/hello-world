# hello-world
First assignment for Dr. Deren Eaton's programming in data science class, Columbia University spring 2021. This repo can hold some of my ideas and drafts of ideas for improving workflow and coding

I'm particularly interested in how to make programs that facilitate citizen-science research and making scientific research accessible, easy, and transparent to people outside of academia and private industry. 
I've been recently revisiting A Tribe Called Quest's discography, which is unbelievably good. 
Also, if anybody can explain the ending of Giri/Haji I would love to know what is going there at the end.
